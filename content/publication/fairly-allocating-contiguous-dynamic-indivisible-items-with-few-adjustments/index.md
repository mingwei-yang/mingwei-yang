abstract: We study the problem of dynamically allocating indivisible items to a
  group of agents in a fair manner. We assume that the items are goods and the
  valuation functions are additive without specification. Due to the negative
  results to achieve fairness, we allow adjustments to make fairness attainable
  with the objective to minimize the number of adjustments. We obtain positive
  results to achieve EF1 for (1) two agents with mixed manna, (2) restricted
  additive or general identical valuations, and (3) the default setting. We
  further impose the contiguity constraint on the items and require that each
  agent obtains a consecutive block of items. We obtain both positive and
  negative results to achieve either EF1 or proportionality with an additive
  approximate factor. In particular, we establish matching lower and upper
  bounds to achieve approximate proportionality for identical valuations. Our
  results exhibit the large discrepancy between the identical model and
  nonidentical model in both contiguous and noncontiguous settings. All our
  positive results are computationally efficient.
