abstract: "In the problem of (binary) contextual bandits with knapsacks (CBwK),
  the agent receives an i.i.d. context in each of the $T$ rounds and chooses an
  action, resulting in a random reward and a random consumption of resources
  that are related to an i.i.d. external factor. The agent's goal is to maximize
  the accumulated reward under the initial resource constraints. In this work,
  we combine the re-solving heuristic, which proved successful in revenue
  management, with distribution estimation techniques to solve this problem. We
  consider two different information feedback models, with full and partial
  information,  which vary in the difficulty of getting a sample of the external
  factor. Under both information feedback settings, we achieve two-way results:
  (1) For general problems, we show that our algorithm gets an $\\widetilde
  O(T^{\\alpha_u} + T^{\\alpha_v} + T^{1/2})$ regret against the fluid
  benchmark. Here, $\\alpha_u$ and $\\alpha_v$ reflect the complexity of the
  context and external factor distributions, respectively. This result is
  comparable to existing results. (2) When the fluid problem is linear
  programming with a unique and non-degenerate optimal solution, our algorithm
  leads to an $\\widetilde O(1)$ regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is
  the first $\\widetilde O(1)$ regret result in the CBwK problem regardless of
  information feedback models. We further use numerical experiments to verify
  our results."
