I am a Ph.D. student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shaofeng Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/). My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, especially in algorithm design and analysis and algorithmic game theory. Currently, I am working on fair division problems.

My Chinese name is 杨明炜. I am crazy about [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) and I was the captain of the rock climbing team at the [Mountaineering Association of Peking University](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B1%B1%E9%B9%B0%E7%A4%BE).
