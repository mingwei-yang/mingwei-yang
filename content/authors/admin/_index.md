I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at Peking University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, especially the intersection of computer science and economics. I have been working on algorithm design and analysis, computational social choide, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning.
