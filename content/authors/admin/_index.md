I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) advised by Prof. [Aviad Rubinstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~aviad/) and Prof. [Amin Saberi](https://stanford.edu/~saberi/).
I also closely work with Prof. [Sophie Yu](https://sophieyu.me/) and Prof. [Biaoshuai Tao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~bstao/).
Prior to joining Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Shaofeng Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/). My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science and its intersection with economics and operations research.

My Chinese name is 杨明炜. I am crazy about [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) and I was the captain of the rock climbing team at the [Mountaineering Association of Peking University](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B1%B1%E9%B9%B0%E7%A4%BE).
