I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at Turing Class, Peking University, where I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). During my undergraduate years, I am also very fortunate to have closely worked with Prof. [Shaofeng Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/) and Prof. [Alexandros Psomas](https://www.alexpsomas.com/).

My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, especially in algorithm design and analysis, and algorithmic game theory.

My Chinese name is 杨明炜. I am crazy about [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing), which is an individual sport that involves problem solving, strength and body control.
