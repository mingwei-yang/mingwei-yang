I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, especially in algorithm design and analysis and algorithmic game theory. Currently, I am working on fair division. During my undergraduate years, I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) on auction, Prof. [Shaofeng Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/) on streaming algorithms, Prof. [Alexandros Psomas](https://www.alexpsomas.com/) and Prof. [Biaoshuai Tao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~bstao/) on fair division, and Prof. [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/home) on graph algorithms.

My Chinese name is 杨明炜. I am crazy about [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) and I was the captain of the rock climbing team at the [Mountaineering Association of Peking University](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B1%B1%E9%B9%B0%E7%A4%BE).

I will be joining the [Management Science and Engineering department](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) in fall 2023!
